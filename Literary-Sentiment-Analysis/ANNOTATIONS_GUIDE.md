## Example Use Cases

### 📚 Student Analyzing "The Raven"

**Selected Text:** "Once upon a midnight dreary"
**Annotation:** "Sets a dark, Gothic tone immediately. 'Dreary' suggests emotional exhaustion, foreshadowing the narrator's mental state."

**Selected Text:** "nevermore"
**Annotation:** "Repeated 11 times - this is the central motif. Represents finality and hopelessness. The raven only knows this one word but it perfectly torments the narrator."

**Selected Text:** "Lenore"
**Annotation:** "The lost love. Her name rhymes with 'nevermore' - poetic connection between loss and finality."

---

### ✍️ Writer Self-Editing

**Selected Text:** "The sunset was beautiful"
**Annotation:** "⚠️ Too generic! Replace with specific imagery - 'crimson streaked across the horizon' or 'amber light filtered through clouds'"

**Selected Text:** "She felt sad"
**Annotation:** "Show don't tell - describe physical manifestations: tears, heavy chest, slumped shoulders"

**Selected Text:** "very quiet"
**Annotation:** "Delete 'very' - use stronger adjective like 'silent' or 'hushed'"

---

### 👨‍🏫 Teacher Lesson Prep

**Selected Text:** "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
**Annotation:** "RHETORICAL QUESTION - discuss with class why Shakespeare poses this as question rather than statement. What effect does this create?"

**Selected Text:** "Thou art more lovely and more temperate"
**Annotation:** "Metaphor begins! Beloved is superior to summer. Ask students: what are downsides of summer mentioned in next lines?"

**Selected Text:** "thy eternal summer"
**Annotation:** "KEY LINE - poetry itself grants immortality. Connect to broader theme of art vs. time."

---

### 📖 Book Club Discussion

**Selected Text:** "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"
**Annotation:** "Paradox! How can both be true? Discuss: whose perspective? Different classes experiencing same era differently?"

**Selected Text:** "all going direct to Heaven, all going direct the other way"
**Annotation:** "Satirical tone - 'the other way' = Hell but he won't say it directly. Victorian propriety vs brutal honesty."
