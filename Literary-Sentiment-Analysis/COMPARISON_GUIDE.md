## 💡 Example Comparisons

### Example 1: Comparing Two Poets

**Text 1: Robert Frost**
```
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
```

**Text 2: Emily Dickinson**
```
Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words.
```

**Compare:**
- Frost: **Contemplative, duty-focused** (themes: duty, journey)
- Dickinson: **Hopeful, optimistic** (themes: hope, nature)
- Frost: More **complex syntax**, higher grade level
- Dickinson: Simpler language, **central metaphor**
- Frost: Neutral-to-melancholic sentiment
- Dickinson: Positive sentiment (95%)

---

### Example 2: Comparing Translations

**Original (Spanish):**
```
Verde que te quiero verde.
Verde viento. Verdes ramas.
```

**Translation (English):**
```
Green how I love you green.
Green wind. Green branches.
```

**Compare:**
- **Language detection:** Auto-detects Spanish vs English
- **Sentiment:** Both positive (amor/love)
- **Devices:** Repetition of "verde/green" in both
- **Word count:** Translation slightly longer
- **Cultural nuances:** Spanish may score higher on emotion

---

### Example 3: Comparing Draft Versions

**Draft 1 (Original):**
```
The sunset was beautiful and made me feel happy.
I watched it from my window.
```

**Draft 2 (Revised):**
```
Crimson streaked across the horizon,
igniting the sky with impossible color—
I pressed my palm to cold glass, breathless.
```

**Compare:**
- Draft 1: **Generic, telling** ("beautiful," "happy")
- Draft 2: **Specific imagery** (crimson, igniting)
- Draft 1: Lower emotional intensity
- Draft 2: More literary devices (metaphor, imagery)
- Draft 1: Grade 4 readability
- Draft 2: Grade 8 readability
- Draft 2: Higher lexical diversity
